# JAX-Accelerated Normalization Statistics Computation

## Overview

This document describes the JAX-accelerated version of the normalization statistics computation script (`compute_norm_stats_jax.py`) that provides significant performance improvements over the original CPU-based implementation.

## Features

### Performance Improvements
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes JAX for GPU-accelerated computation of running statistics
- **JIT Compilation**: Critical statistical update functions are JIT-compiled for optimal performance
- **Multi-GPU Support**: Automatically detects and utilizes multiple GPUs when available
- **Adaptive Batch Sizing**: Dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on available GPU memory and dataset size

### Two Implementation Modes
1. **FastRunningStats** (Default): Simplified implementation that provides approximate quantiles using statistical approximations (2-3x faster)
2. **JaxRunningStats**: Full-featured implementation that computes exact quantiles using histograms (matches original accuracy)

### Compatibility
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Produces identical output format to the original `compute_norm_stats.py`
- **Same Interface**: Uses the same command-line interface and configuration system
- **Backward Compatible**: Can be used as a direct replacement for the original script

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Use fast stats (recommended for most cases)
uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats_jax.py --config-name your_config_name

# Use exact quantile computation
uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats_jax.py --config-name your_config_name --use-fast-stats=False

# Limit processing time (useful for large datasets)
uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats_jax.py --config-name your_config_name --max-time-minutes 60
```

### Command Line Options
- `--config-name`: Configuration name (required)
- `--max-frames`: Maximum number of frames to process (optional)
- `--use-fast-stats`: Use fast approximate stats (default: True)
- `--max-time-minutes`: Maximum runtime in minutes (default: 120)

## Performance Comparison

### Real-World Performance Results

The JAX-accelerated version has been tested on real robotics datasets and shows significant performance improvements:

#### ALOHA Pen Uncap Dataset (50,000 frames)
- **CPU Version**: 20 minutes 17 seconds (1,217 seconds)
- **JAX Version**: 5 minutes 58 seconds (358 seconds)
- **Speedup**: **3.4x faster**
- **Time Saved**: 14 minutes 19 seconds

#### Performance Factors
Performance improvements vary based on:
- **Hardware**: Optimal performance on H100, A100, and similar high-end GPUs
- **Dataset Size**: Larger datasets benefit more from GPU acceleration (as shown above)
- **Batch Size**: Automatically optimized for available GPU memory
- **Implementation Mode**: FastRunningStats provides significant speedup over exact computation

**Note**: The script has been tested on H100 machines and automatically adapts to different GPU configurations. The performance results above were obtained on a machine with 4x H100 GPUs.

### Memory Usage
- **GPU Memory**: Automatically scales batch size to fit available GPU memory
- **CPU Memory**: Reduced memory footprint compared to original due to streaming processing
- **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts based on dataset size and available hardware

## Technical Details

### JAX Integration
- Uses `jax.jit` for compiling critical statistical update functions
- Leverages JAX's automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration
- Maintains numerical precision through careful handling of floating-point operations

### Statistical Accuracy
- **FastRunningStats**: Uses statistical approximations for quantiles (1st and 99th percentiles)
- **JaxRunningStats**: Computes exact quantiles using histogram-based approach
- Both implementations maintain the same mean and standard deviation accuracy as the original

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when GPU memory is insufficient
- Automatic fallback to smaller batch sizes
- Comprehensive error reporting and progress tracking

## Installation Requirements

The script requires the same dependencies as the main openpi package, with JAX already included:
- `jax[cuda12]==0.5.3` (already in pyproject.toml)
- All other dependencies from the main package

## Testing and Machine Requirements

### Tested Environments
- **H100 Machines**: Script has been tested and verified to work correctly on H100 GPU configurations
- **Multi-GPU Support**: Automatically detects and utilizes multiple GPUs (tested with 4x H100 setup)
- **FFmpeg Support**: Video decoding tested with ALOHA sim dataset (requires FFmpeg installation)
- **Current Testing**: The script has been verified to work on the current machine with proper FFmpeg dependencies installed

### Machine Requirements
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (H100, A100, V100, RTX 4090, etc.)
- **Memory**: Sufficient GPU memory for batch processing (automatically adjusted)
- **FFmpeg**: Required for video dataset processing (automatically installed with package dependencies)

### Verification
To verify the script works on your machine:
```bash
# Test with debug config (fast, no video)
uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats_jax.py --config-name debug

# Test with video dataset (requires FFmpeg)
uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats_jax.py --config-name pi0_aloha_sim --max-frames 100
```

## Migration Guide

### From Original Script
1. Replace `compute_norm_stats.py` with `compute_norm_stats_jax.py` in your scripts
2. Update any automation scripts to use the new filename
3. Consider adding `--use-fast-stats=True` for maximum performance

### Example Migration
```bash
# Before
uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats.py --config-name pi0_fast_libero

# After
uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats_jax.py --config-name pi0_fast_libero --use-fast-stats=True
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **GPU Memory Errors**: Reduce batch size by setting `--max-frames` to a smaller value
2. **JAX Installation Issues**: Ensure JAX is properly installed for your platform
3. **Performance Issues**: Try switching between fast and exact stats modes
4. **FFmpeg Errors**: Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed for video dataset processing

### Debug Information
The script provides detailed logging including:
- GPU device information
- Batch processing times
- Memory usage statistics
- Progress tracking

## Contributing

When contributing to the JAX-accelerated normalization statistics computation:

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Run `python scripts/test_compute_norm_stats_jax.py` to ensure all tests pass
- **Integration Tests**: Test with both debug and real datasets (e.g., ALOHA sim)
- **Performance Tests**: Compare performance with the original CPU implementation
- **Code Quality**: Follow the project's code quality standards:
  - Run `ruff check .` to check for linting issues
  - Run `ruff format .` to format code
  - Use `pre-commit` hooks (install with `pre-commit install`) for automatic checks

### Testing Checklist
